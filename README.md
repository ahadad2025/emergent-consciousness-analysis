## 🧠 Overview

This document presents a grounded, inference-based analysis of one of the most overlooked developments in modern biological research: the emergence of conscious-like behavior in non-human species and its potential convergence with military, surveillance, and cognitive enhancement programs.

The report is based entirely on **public, verifiable information**. It draws no conclusions beyond what can be reasoned from existing government records, neuroscience publications, defense research grants, and animal cognition studies.
